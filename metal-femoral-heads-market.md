<p><strong>The Metal Femoral Heads Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HIP Surface Replacement</li><li>Total HIP Replacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal femoral heads market primarily serves two key applications in hip joint restoration: hip surface replacement and total hip replacement. In hip surface replacement, a smaller metal component caps the top of the femur to preserve more bone stock, offering a less invasive alternative for younger patients. In contrast, total hip replacement involves replacing the entire femoral head along with the acetabulum, providing a solution for severe joint degeneration. Both applications aim to alleviate pain and restore mobility.</p></p>
