<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Custom Car Wrap Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Film</li><li>Calendered Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The custom car wrap film market consists primarily of two types: cast film and calendered film. Cast film is made by pouring molten polymer into a mold, resulting in a thinner, more flexible material that conforms well to vehicle contours and offers superior durability and vibrant colors. Calendered film, on the other hand, is produced by rolling out the material through heated rollers, making it thicker and less flexible. While it is generally more affordable, calendered film may not adhere as smoothly on complex surfaces compared to cast film.</p></p>
